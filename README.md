# boxes

This origionally started off as an automated deployment for penetration testing windows thick clients, and now its grown into an automated deployemnt of penetration testing tools for Windows and Kali.

## installation

to automate the installation of the VM's your'll need [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). This can normally be found from your package manager. For some of the VM's I've used the following `vagrant` plugins.

 - [vagrant-timezone](https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-timezone)
 - [vagrant-reload](https://github.com/aidanns/vagrant-reload)

once all installed, open up a shell in each directroy and type `vagrant up` and wait, I really mean it, nobody said this was going to be fast.
